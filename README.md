# Personal Website

This website is my personal portfolio, built to showcase my projects, background, and creative side as a computer engineer.  
The site is deployed using **GitHub Pages** and designed with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for simplicity and full control.

## About the Project

I originally forked this project from [zirafa/simple-website-template](https://github.com/zirafa/simple-website-template) as a lightweight starter.  
Since then, I’ve completely customized the structure, layout, and style to build my own personal website.

Key changes include:
- Rebuilt layout structure (navigation bar, sections, and content organization)
- New design system with updated color palette and typography
- Responsive layout and better usability
- Custom portfolio section with project links and GitHub integration
- Multi-language content (Turkish / English)
- Personalized visuals, icons, and footer

## Deployment

The website is hosted via **GitHub Pages** on the `gh-pages` branch.
